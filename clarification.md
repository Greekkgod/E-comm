I am unable to directly edit files outside of the current project directory or its subdirectories. The `GEMINI.md` file you referenced appears to be located outside of this project's workspace.

If you intended to edit a `GEMINI.md` file within the current project, please provide its full path.

If you were referring to the "Gemini Added Memories" context that was provided to me at the start of our chat, I cannot directly edit my own operational context. This information is provided to me by the CLI and is read-only for me.

Please clarify which file you would like me to edit, or if you intended to modify the initial context provided.
