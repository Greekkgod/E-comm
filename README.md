cd dashboard
(Replace your-username/dashboard.git with your actual repository URL)Install dependencies:npm install
Available ScriptsIn the project directory, you can run:npm run devRuns the app in development mode.Open http://localhost:5173 to view it in your browser.The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.npm run buildBuilds the app for production to the dist folder.It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!npm run lintRuns ESLint to check for code quality issues and potential errors.npm run previewLocally previews the production build. This is useful for checking how the built application will behave before deploying.Project Structure.

Deployment (Netlify)This project includes a netlify.toml file, indicating it's configured for deployment on Netlify. The configuration sets up a redirect rule to serve index.html for all routes, which is typical for single-page applications (SPAs).To deploy:Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify.Netlify will automatically detect the netlify.toml and package.json scripts.Configure the build command as npm run build and the publish directory as dist.LintingESLint is configured to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices. The configuration includes plugins for React and React Hooks, as well as eslint-plugin-react-refresh for Vite's Fast Refresh.To run linting manually:npm run lint
